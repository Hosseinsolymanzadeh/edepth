# edepth: Depth Estimation Model

## Overview

edepth is a deep learning model designed for depth estimation from single images. Depth estimation is a crucial task in computer vision, finding applications in various fields such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. edepth addresses this task by predicting the distance of objects from the camera using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Model Architecture

The edepth model architecture is inspired by the DenseNet and U-Net architectures, which have shown success in image segmentation tasks. The architecture consists of an encoder-decoder structure. The encoder comprises multiple dense blocks, each containing convolutional layers with shared feature maps concatenated across layers. Transition layers follow dense blocks to reduce the number of channels and spatial dimensions. The decoder consists of upsampling layers to reconstruct the depth map from the encoded features.
