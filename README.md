# edepth: Depth Estimation Model

## Overview

edepth is a cutting-edge deep learning model designed to estimate depth from various input sources, including single images, videos, and live camera feeds. Depth estimation is a crucial task in computer vision, with applications in autonomous driving, robotics, augmented reality, and more. edepth addresses this task by predicting the distance of objects from the camera using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Model Architecture

The edepth model architecture is inspired by DenseNet and U-Net architectures, which have shown success in image segmentation tasks. The model consists of an encoder-decoder structure.

### Encoder
The encoder extracts features from the input data using multiple dense blocks, each containing convolutional layers with shared feature maps concatenated across layers. Transition layers follow dense blocks to reduce the number of channels and spatial dimensions.

### Fully Connected Layers
Between the encoder and decoder, the model includes fully connected layers to process the features:
- `fullyConnectedI`: Linear layer transforming the encoder output to a fixed-size vector.
- `fullyConnectedII`: Linear layer transforming the fixed-size vector back to the size expected by the decoder.

### Decoder
The decoder reconstructs the depth map from the encoded features using upsampling layers.
